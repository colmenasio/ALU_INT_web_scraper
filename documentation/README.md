# About this project's documentaton
In this project most of the documentation is written in the source in the form of **docstrings**, 
due the convinience that arrises from using them as a main source of documentation.

As such, the markdowns in this directory have the sole purpose of describing the modules in a broader sense,
not in at function-level. Only surface level docs and examples
