# Basically just another TODO list (the 12th one at this point....)

- Add support for adding more websites to an already existing database automatically
- Improve error handling
- Make the script more user-friendly by implementing command line prompts and stuff (Prompting credentials and so on)
- Probablly check dependencies cause the TOML file is missing some for sure...
- Deal with the 3204204899 pending `#TODO`s
- Remove uneccesary stuff from source control.
- Acessing the website definitions manually is an absolute pain and its done several times on several scripts. Make a 
wrapper class to handle the getting data from the website definitions.
- Restructure the disaster class and the handling of the database connection so that propper
context management can be implemented rigth now its just a ticking bomb :3
- Tell Matheus about the Floodlist Firewall `Sucuri WebSite Firewall - Access Denied`
- Maybe switch to parametrized queries to avoid edge cases....
- Add more error handling and debug tools to MySQL for gods sake AAAAAAA
