# Basically a TODO list (the 12th one at this point....)

- Improve error handling
- Make the script more user-friendly by implementing command line prompts and stuff (Prompting credentials and so on)
- Probablly check dependencies cause the TOML file is missing some for sure...
- Deal with the 3204204899 pending `#TODO`s
- Remove uneccesary stuff from source control.
