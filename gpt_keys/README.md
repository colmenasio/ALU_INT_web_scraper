# README

ok so basically just create a `.txt` file named `keys.txt` in this folder. The file must contain 2 lines, the first one containing the general api key and the second one the organisation key.

Eg: 
```{txt}
sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
org-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Disclaimer: The script that uses this is horribly picky and needs to be fixed asap.
