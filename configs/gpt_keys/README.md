# README

ok so basically just create a `.json` file named `keys.txt` in this folder. The file must contain 2 lines, the first one containing the general api key and the second one the organisation key.

Eg: 
```{json}
{
    "key": "sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "organisation": "org-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
```

The organization field is optional if your key does not require an organization key
